# Shell, permissions

Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, differ from other computer systems
in that they are not only multitasking, but also multiuser.

This means that more than one user can use the computer at the same time.
Although a desktop or laptop computer has only one keyboard and one monitor,
it can be used by more than one user.
